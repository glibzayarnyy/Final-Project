Reflection:

This project has helped me sharpen my c++ skills in every category.

Milestone 1 started out being fairly simple, It taught me various things such as how to parse strings and how to use static variables. Milestone 2 proved to be a little more difficult as i had to learn how to use an array of pointers and had to deal with a lot of memory leak problems. Milestone 3 was definitely the hardest milestone, it involved in a lot of inheritance and FIFO, LIFO in queues and deques.

Overall this project has taught me a lot, i now feel more comfortable coding in c++ and have learned many new skills.
